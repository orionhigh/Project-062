# ETRN Configuration File for Mercury/32
#
# Mercury can 'kick-start' remote queues by sending SMTP ETRN
# commands to the servers that host those queues. This file
# tells Mercury which hosts it needs to contact, and the name of
# the queues it should trigger on those hosts.
#
# Enter the name of a host that Mercury should contact hard
# against the left-hand margin of this file. Then on subsequent
# lines, enter the names of the domains that should be triggered,
# indented by at least one space. Repeat this process for all the
# hosts Mercury should contact. Blank lines, and lines starting
# with '#' are treated as comments and ignored.
# 
# Example: you want Mercury to contact the host 'mail.caramba.org'
# and ask it to trigger the mail queues for 'arriba.com' and
# 'ayayay.com': you would create the following entry:
#
# mail.caramba.org
#   arriba.com
#   ayayay.com
